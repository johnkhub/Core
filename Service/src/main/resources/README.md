Database Schema Management
==========================

* There is a changelog for each schema
* Note the split into the common schemas and a *client specific* schema. `dtpw` is an example of this.
* The sub-folders contains sql scripts that are executed by Liquibase
* Refer to commandline reference for how the application manages the schemas
